                        I saw these and they look really nice for taking the casing off of the end of wires easier.

                        I only linked these because they were the latest ones, but I'm just looking for AirPods that have Active Noise Cancellation, unlike the ones I have now. If you get an engraved one, I would like it to just say "Boyne".

                        I keep needing to sharpen pencils and it gets annoying because my portable sharpener keeps opening and spilling shavings everywhere. Metal mechanical pencils would make that easier.

                        A NAS would be useful for storing files like Google Drive, except with more storage and inside the house. I'd need to add my own drives, but I have some. It may be a good idea to buy bigger ones for this device, though, but it's easy to find 4-8TB internal HDDs on Newegg or Amazon.
