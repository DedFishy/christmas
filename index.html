                        I saw these and they look really nice for taking the casing off of the end of wires easier.

                        I only linked these because they were the latest ones, but I'm just looking for AirPods that have Active Noise Cancellation, unlike the ones I have now. If you get an engraved one, I would like it to just say "Boyne".

                        I just would like to have a decent supply of them. I'm not really concerned about the length or tensile strength.
